        |The UML sequence diagrams must be specified with PlantUML.
        |Arrows between actors are considered as requests and responses.
        |Actors are considered services. The actor with the first outgoing arrow is considered the client.
        |Test cases emulate requests of the client against other actors.
        |
        |DIAGRAM FORMAT
        |==============
        |
        |The text on arrows need to follow a certain format to be recognized as requests or responses.
        |For requests, this is:
        |
        |   <METHOD> "<PATH>" (<PARAM_NAME> : "<PARAM_VALUE>"[, ...])
        |
        |Where <METHOD> is one of 'GET', 'POST', 'PUT', 'DELETE', 'PATCH'
        |<PATH> is the relative URL.
        |Params are parameter pairs. Depending on the type of request, they will either be used as query or form params.
        |
        |All values that are in quotes can contain arbitrary variable substitutions of the form "$\{VARIABLE_NAME\}".
        |Variables can either be imported via the configuration file or from previous responses.
        |
        |Similarly, responses need to follow the following schema:
        |
        |<CODE>
        |  or
        |<CODE> - (<VARIABLE_NAME> : "<XPATH_TO_VARIABLE>"[, ...])
        |
        |Where <CODE> is one or a comma-separated list of allowed HTTP response codes.
        |<XPATH_TO_VARIABLE> is a path to a certain value in a JSON or XML body following the XPATH scheme.
        |The value of <XPATH_TO_VARIABLE> will be checked for being present and will then be assigned to
        |<VARIABLE_NAME> for later use.
        |
        |Plantestic also allows conditional requests. They should be put in UML "alt" blocks within PlantUML.
        |The condition might be any valid JavaScript code with any arbitrary templating variables.
        |Before the code will be evaluated, the templating engine will replace all variables in "$\{VAR\}".
        |The condition should return true or false.
        |
        |CONFIG FILE
        |===========
        |
        |Because your test might contain sensitive data or data you quickly want to change between tests,
        |Plantestic also supports config files in .toml format.
        |You can define arbitrary variables and their values in the [Templating] section.
        |Every service might additionally get values for "path", "username" and "password".
        |
        |Example:
        |--------
        |
        |[Templating]
        |id = "asdf"
        |important_value = 5
        |
        |[ServiceA]
        |path = "www.example.com"
        |username = "admin"
        |password = "admin"
